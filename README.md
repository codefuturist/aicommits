## Setup

> The minimum supported version of Node.js is v22. Check your Node.js version with `node --version`.

1. Install _aicommits_:

   **From this fork (includes GitHub Copilot & Mistral providers, `split` command):**

   ```sh
   # pnpm — install directly from the monorepo (no clone required)
   pnpm add -g "git+ssh://git@github.com:codefuturist/monorepository.git#develop&path:/apps/cli/aicommits"
   ```

   Or with npm:

   ```sh
   npm install -g "git+ssh://git@github.com/codefuturist/monorepository.git#develop?subdir=apps/cli/aicommits"
   ```

   > **Remote hosts (e.g. `colin@pi1`):** ensure your SSH key is forwarded or added to the host, then run the pnpm/npm command above — it clones, builds, and links the `aicommits`/`aic` binaries in one step.

   Alternatively, via the standalone fork repo:

   ```sh
   pnpm add -g "git+ssh://git@github.com:codefuturist/aicommits.git#develop"
   ```

   **From the original npm package:**

   ```sh
   npm install -g aicommits@develop
   ```

   > We need @develop since v2 is still not released as latest/main!

2. Run the setup command to choose your AI provider:

   ```sh
   aicommits setup
   ```

This will guide you through:

- Selecting your AI provider (sets the `provider` config)
- Configuring your API key
- **Automatically fetching and selecting from available models** (when supported)
- **Choosing your preferred commit message format** (plain, conventional, or gitmoji)

  Supported providers include:

  - **GitHub Copilot** — Uses [GitHub Models API](https://github.com/marketplace/models). Auto-detects token via `gh` CLI. No separate API key needed.
  - **Mistral AI** — Get your API key from [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai)
  - **TogetherAI** — Get your API key from [TogetherAI](https://api.together.ai/)
  - **OpenAI** — Get your API key from [OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
  - **OpenRouter** — Get your API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
  - **Ollama** (local) — Run AI models locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)
  - **LM Studio** (local) — No API key required. Runs on your computer via [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
  - **Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint** — Use any service that implements the OpenAI API

  **For CI/CD environments**, you can also set up configuration via the config file:

  ```bash
  aicommits config set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  aicommits config set OPENAI_BASE_URL="your_api_endpoint"  # Optional, for custom endpoints
  aicommits config set OPENAI_MODEL="your_model_choice"     # Optional, defaults to provider default
  ```

  > **Note:** When using environment variables, ensure all related variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL`) are set consistently to avoid configuration mismatches with the config file.

  This will create a `.aicommits` file in your home directory.

### Upgrading

Check the installed version with:

```sh
aicommits --version
```

If it's not the latest version, reinstall with the same install command above.

## Usage

### CLI mode

You can call `aicommits` directly to generate a commit message for your staged changes:

```sh
git add <files...>
aicommits
```

`aicommits` passes down unknown flags to `git commit`, so you can pass in [`commit` flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).

For example, you can stage all changes in tracked files as you commit:

```sh
aicommits --all # or -a
```

> 👉 **Tip:** Use the `aic` alias if `aicommits` is too long for you.

#### CLI Options

- `--all` or `-a`: Automatically stage changes in tracked files for the commit (default: **false**)
- `--clipboard` or `-c`: Copy the selected message to the clipboard instead of committing (default: **false**)
- `--generate` or `-g`: Number of messages to generate (default: **1**)
- `--exclude` or `-x`: Files to exclude from AI analysis
- `--type` or `-t`: Git commit message format (default: **plain**). Supports `plain`, `conventional`, and `gitmoji`
- `--prompt` or `-p`: Custom prompt to guide the AI behavior (e.g., language, style)
- `--yes` or `-y`: Skip confirmation when committing after message generation (default: **false**)

#### Generate multiple recommendations

Sometimes the recommended commit message isn't the best so you want it to generate a few to pick from. You can generate multiple commit messages at once by passing in the `--generate <i>` flag, where 'i' is the number of generated messages:

```sh
aicommits --generate <i> # or -g <i>
```

> Warning: this uses more tokens, meaning it costs more.

#### Commit Message Formats

You can choose from three different commit message formats:

- **plain** (default): Simple, unstructured commit messages
- **conventional**: [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format with type and scope
- **gitmoji**: Emoji-based commit messages

Use the `--type` flag to specify the format:

```sh
aicommits --type conventional # or -t conventional
aicommits --type gitmoji       # or -t gitmoji
aicommits --type plain         # or -t plain (default)
```

### AI-powered commit splitting (`aicommits split`)

The `split` command uses AI to **group your changes into multiple logical atomic commits** — perfect for large changesets or mixed work.

```sh
aicommits split
```

> **Alias:** `aicommits stage` also works for backward compatibility.

#### How it works

1. Detects changed files (unstaged by default)
2. For large repos, auto-detects **project boundaries** (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, Chart.yaml, etc.) to avoid overloading the AI
3. Groups files into logical commits using AI
4. Presents groups for review, then stages and commits each one

#### Split — Flags

| Flag | Alias | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--staged` | `-S` | Split **already-staged** files into multiple commits |
| `--all` | `-a` | Include untracked files (unstaged mode only) |
| `--dry-run` | `-d` | Show proposed groups without committing |
| `--scan` | | Show detected project boundaries and exit (no AI calls) |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Auto-commit all groups without confirmation |
| `--max-groups` | `-m` | Maximum groups per boundary (default: 3) |
| `--scope` | `-s` | Only process changes in a specific directory/boundary |
| `--type` | `-t` | Commit message format (`plain`, `conventional`, `gitmoji`) |
| `--prompt` | `-p` | Custom prompt to guide grouping behavior |

#### Examples

```sh
# Preview proposed groups without committing
aicommits split --dry-run

# Auto-commit all groups (no confirmation)
aicommits split --yes

# Include untracked files
aicommits split --all

# Split already-staged files into multiple commits
git add -A
aicommits split --staged

# Show detected project boundaries first
aicommits split --scan

# Focus on a specific subdirectory
aicommits split --scope apps/api

# Use conventional commits format
aicommits split --type conventional

# Guided grouping with a custom prompt
aicommits split --prompt "Group by feature area, keep docs separate"
```

#### Staged mode (`--staged`)

When you have files already staged with `git add`, use `--staged` to split them into multiple atomic commits instead of one big one:

```sh
git add -A               # stage everything
aicommits split --staged # AI splits into logical groups, commits each
```

> ⚠️ **Partially staged files** (where only some hunks are staged): you'll be warned that proceeding will stage ALL changes for those files.

#### Project boundary detection

For large repos with many changed files, `aicommits split` automatically detects project boundaries — subdirectories that are independent projects (detected via `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Chart.yaml`, etc.). Each boundary is analyzed separately to avoid overloading the AI and produce more meaningful groupings.

Use `--scan` to see what boundaries were detected without making any AI calls:

```sh
aicommits split --scan
```

### Git hook

You can also integrate _aicommits_ with Git via the [`prepare-commit-msg`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook. This lets you use Git like you normally would, and edit the commit message before committing.

#### Install

In the Git repository you want to install the hook in:

```sh
aicommits hook install
```

#### Uninstall

In the Git repository you want to uninstall the hook from:

```sh
aicommits hook uninstall
```

#### Usage

1. Stage your files and commit:

   ```sh
   git add <files...>
   git commit # Only generates a message when it's not passed in
   ```

   > If you ever want to write your own message instead of generating one, you can simply pass one in: `git commit -m "My message"`

2. Aicommits will generate the commit message for you and pass it back to Git. Git will open it with the [configured editor](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git) for you to review/edit it.

3. Save and close the editor to commit!

### Environment Variables

You can also configure aicommits using environment variables instead of the config file.

**Example:**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.example.com"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"
aicommits  # Uses environment variables
```

Configuration settings are resolved in the following order of precedence:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file
4. Default values

## Configuration

### Viewing current configuration

To view all current configuration options that differ from defaults, run:

```sh
aicommits config
```

This will display only non-default configuration values with API keys masked for security. If no custom configuration is set, it will show "(using all default values)".

### Changing your model

To interactively select or change your AI model, run:

```sh
aicommits model
```

This will:

- Show your current provider and model
- Fetch available models from your provider's API
- Let you select from available models or enter a custom model name
- Update your configuration automatically

### Reading a configuration value

To retrieve a configuration option, use the command:

```sh
aicommits config get <key>
```

For example, to retrieve the API key, you can use:

```sh
aicommits config get OPENAI_API_KEY
```

You can also retrieve multiple configuration options at once by separating them with spaces:

```sh
aicommits config get OPENAI_API_KEY generate
```

### Setting a configuration value

To set a configuration option, use the command:

```sh
aicommits config set <key>=<value>
```

For example, to set the API key, you can use:

```sh
aicommits config set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

You can also set multiple configuration options at once by separating them with spaces, like

```sh
aicommits config set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key> generate=3 locale=en
```

### Config Options

#### OPENAI_API_KEY

Your OpenAI API key or custom provider API Key.

#### OPENAI_BASE_URL

Custom OpenAI-compatible API endpoint URL.

#### OPENAI_MODEL

Model to use for OpenAI-compatible providers.

#### provider

The selected AI provider. Set automatically during `aicommits setup`. Valid values: `openai`, `copilot`, `mistral`, `togetherai`, `openrouter`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `custom`.

#### locale

Default: `en`

The locale to use for the generated commit messages. Consult the list of codes in: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes.

#### generate

Default: `1`

The number of commit messages to generate to pick from.

Note, this will use more tokens as it generates more results.

#### timeout

The timeout for network requests in milliseconds.

Default: `10000` (10 seconds)

```sh
aicommits config set timeout=20000 # 20s
```

#### max-length

The maximum character length of the generated commit message.

Default: `72`

```sh
aicommits config set max-length=100
```

#### type

Default: `plain`

The type of commit message to generate. Available options:

- `plain`: Simple, unstructured commit messages
- `conventional`: Conventional Commits format with type and scope
- `gitmoji`: Emoji-based commit messages

Examples:

```sh
aicommits config set type=conventional
aicommits config set type=gitmoji
aicommits config set type=plain
```

## How it works

This CLI tool runs `git diff` to grab all your latest code changes, sends them to the configured AI provider, then returns the AI generated commit message.

The `split` command uses project boundary detection to intelligently split large diffs into focused per-project chunks before sending to the AI, preventing rate limiting and producing more contextually accurate groupings.
